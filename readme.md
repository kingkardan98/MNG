## MNNG - Manage you money

MNNG (read Manage) is a simple Python project that showcases backend programming capabilities of the author.

It simulates a money manager, in a simple but elegant way: a user can create multiple "members", which represent the different monetary accounts the user possesses.

The website is fully written in Python, and it uses a lightweight SQLite3 database.
Resource routing, HTTP responses and database operations are all managed using the <a href='https://www.djangoproject.com'>Django framework.</a>
Basic HTML is used to render the website, and CSS is still missing at this point.

Still extremely proud of the project's size and attention to detail.
